## Guide to letters

### FulDigitizationDocumentDeliveryNotificationLetter
This letter is triggered when a digitized item is sent to a user via Alma. Note that there are two workflows in Alma:
1. When the file is less than 25MB and can be sent through Alma
2. When the file is greater than 25MB and the file needs to be sent via ArticleExchange. In this case, we attach a note and a URL which are then added to the letter.
